## Overview

This repository contains a critical review and re-analysis of the study titled **"Evaluation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19 (COPCOV): A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial"** ([DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004428](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004428)). The main focus of this review was to assess the accuracy and methodology used in the original publication, with an emphasis on identifying errors in the reported effect sizes and confidence intervals, as well as evaluating the suitability of statistical tests applied.

## Key Findings and Methodological Issues

1. **Fisher's Exact Test**: The authors of the COPCOV study relied on Fisher’s exact test to calculate p-values for the primary outcomes, as shown in Table 2 of the original paper. However, this approach is generally inappropriate for clinical efficacy studies, as it is designed for small sample sizes and binary comparisons without adjusting for covariates (e.g., age, comorbidities). 

2. **Inclusion of Covariates**: Clinical efficacy analysis benefits from models that incorporate covariates to control for potential confounding factors. A Cox proportional hazards model would provide a more robust analysis for evaluating the effects of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine on COVID-19 incidence.

3. **Non-Proportional Hazards**: The assumption of proportional hazards does not hold in this study, which undermines the validity of the log-rank test results.

4. The p-value for the primary endpoint was reported using Fisher's exact test, which is not suitable for this type of clinical efficacy data. Upon recalculating the p-value using a Poisson regression model, we observed that the result is no longer statistically significant, further questioning the findings' robustness.

5. **Errors in Reported Effect Sizes**: Upon reviewing the study meta-analysis results, discrepancies were noted in the reported effect sizes and confidence intervals. For instance:
   - **Vijayaraghavan et al. (2022)**: The meta-analysis reported a risk ratio (RR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.40–1.95), but the original values were RR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.35–2.07).
   - **Llanos-Cuentas et al. (2023)**: The meta-analysis cited RR = 1.48 (95% CI 0.38–5.71), while the study reported RR = 1.69 (95% CI 0.41–7.11).
  
   
   These errors indicate potential transcription mistakes, which could affect the overall conclusions of the meta-analysis.

## Recommendations

1. **Reassessment of Included Studies**: It is recommended to re-examine each study included in the meta-analysis to ensure accurate data extraction and transcription of effect sizes and confidence intervals.
   
2. **Utilize Cox Models**: A Cox proportional hazards model could be used to analyze the time-to-event data with adjustments for covariates, addressing the limitations of Fisher’s exact test for this dataset. Kaplan-Meier curves, as descriptive tools, could supplement the Cox model results to illustrate differences between treatment groups.

3. **Non-Proportional Hazards**: Given the issue of non-proportional hazards, we recommend the use of a Cox regression model with time-varying covariates or stratification to properly account for differences in hazard over time.

4. **Primary outcome**: Fisher's exact test should be avoided for primary endpoints in clinical trials evaluating treatment efficacy, as it does not control for covariates or account for time-to-event data. A Poisson regression model or a Cox model would provide a more reliable p-value and estimate of treatment effect by incorporating relevant covariates and accounting for the time dimension in the analysis.


## Conclusion

This analysis highlights some important concerns about the article "Evaluation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19 (COPCOV): A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial" that should be evaluated by the authors.
